## Description

A basic django authentication system is necessary for control and access within and outside your Django app. With the right setup, you can properly authenticate and authorize users before they can access resources within your application. Having an efficient auth system improves your app's security posture and allows only the right people to have access. Django provides an out of the box experience for authentication, and by leveraging on this, one wouldn't have to worry too much about managing Django web apps' security with third-party service(s).

## Features

Here are what makes the project tick! Please go through the features to see why this project is awesome!

- Simple Dashboard
    - This is the landing page for all authenticated users. However, users would be directed to the login page when they are not authenticated. 
    - You can add customizations to change the looks of the dashboard to suit your taste. 
- User Authentication
    - Guest users can simply create a user account by registering and loggging into the web app.
    - Existing users who've had their session expired would have to re-authenticate again by signing into the web app from the login page
    - Authenticated users can logout when they're done using the app. Logging out would automatically end all active sessions and convert the user into an anon or guest user. So which means, functionalities and services that depends on a user to be authenticated would no longer be available.
- Default Message Framework Integration
    - This only improves the user's experience by letting them know the outcome of the operations that they've completed within the applicaition.
